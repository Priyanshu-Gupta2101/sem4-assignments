# Semester 4 Assignments

- Invest your time writing in code and understanding concepts, and not writing theory.
- Except Microprocessor, just copy it as it is. \*facepalm\*

To access the files, just clone it on your local PC, or fork it if you want to make changes and keep it for yourself.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments
Ctrl C
Ctrl V
```

### [Ananlysis of Algorithms (AOA)](https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Algorithms%20(AOA))

1. To implement Insertion sort and selection sort Algorithm 
2. To implement Quick sort , Merge sort Algorithm 
3. To implement Max min Algorithm 
4. To implement Dijkstra Algorithm 
5. To implement Fractional Knapsack Algorithm 
6. To implement 0/1 knapsack Algorithm 
7. To implement Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm 
8. To implement N QUEENS Algorithm
9. To implement Sum of subsets Algorithm 
10. To implement Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm

### [Database Management System (DBMS)](https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments/tree/main/Database%20Management%20System%20(DBMS))

Here is my complete DBMS case study: [Airport-DBMS](https://github.com/tusharnankani/Airport-DBMS)
- And it has all the queries, experiment by experiment, in a queries.txt file.

### [Microprocessor](https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments/tree/main/Microprocessor%20(MP))

- This subject is outdated and awful, please don't invest your time in it.
- I have just given all the .docx files and the final PDFs.
- To access them, just clone this repository in your local machine and you will get all the files.

### [Operating System](https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments/tree/main/Operating%20System%20(OS))

- This is super important, I have also created a different repository all together for this: [OperatingSystemAlgorithms](https://github.com/tusharnankani/OperatingSystemAlgorithms)
- This subject is super interesting, try not to copy the code. This is just for your help. 

#### *Content*

0. Shell Scripts
1. Memory Allocation Simulator
2. Paging Algorithms 
3. Scheduling Algorithms 
4. Page Replacement Algorithms 
5. Disk Scheduling Algorithms
6. Banker's Algorithm

- built with Java, for a better understanding of Operating System.

### [Python](https://github.com/tusharnankani/sem4-assignments/tree/main/Python)

- And finally, Python. 
- It has everything, from theory to experiment, all in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Write the code, take some help from here, and use them completely for writing Theory.
- Again, the notebooks might take some time, so clone it and access them on your local PC, like you use Jupyter Notebooks.
